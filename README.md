# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer, passionate about software architecture, [data structures/algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/gustavooliveiraf) and DevOps enthusiast. Occasionally I venture into events like [NodeBR](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/nodebr/events/266566596/) and [TDC](https://thedevconf.com/palestrante/gustavo-oliveira). I also create content on posts on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavooliveiraf/detail/recent-activity/shares/).

I love playing cs and football (the latter, both real and virtual). Iâ€™m currently working on Gympass. If you would like to discuss these things, just add me on Linkedin. If you need more information or ask me anything feel free to contact.
